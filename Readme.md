Clisp Source Code v 2.49
========================

Clisp is an implementation of Common Lisp.

This is just **my copy** of their source code, since it was so hard to find, and I couldn't link anyone else to lines within it.
This repo is **not official** in any manner.

* The official page is [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/)
* I got this source code from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clisp/?source=typ_redirect)
