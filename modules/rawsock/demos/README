These are various Rawsock demos.
Most have to be run as a superuser, so beware!

It is best to test all such things on a system that you can easily
reboot and that is not critical to anything, e.g., use bootable CDs and
floppy-based configuration files (write locked except during down-time).
Thus one can push reset and try again on a moment's notice.

Improper use may disrupt not only the local machine, but also
surrounding networks, and who knows what else.
